        <p class="">Data can be a game changer, but by itself it's just data. It becomes powerful when it is used not just to support decisions, but to drive actions. Ultimately, it's about uncovering how your Customers engage with your brand.</p>

   <h5>Value that we create for our Clients:</h5>
    <ul class="numbers">
        <li>
        <h6>360° Customer Profile:</h6>
        <p>Consumer expectations are higher than ever - they expect to get what they want, when they want it and how they want it. </p><p>We provide our Clients with a single, end-to-end picture of their customer’s journey and experience with their company, and how they felt at each step along the journey.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <h6>Personalized Customer Experience:</h6>
        <p>Once we have the required data sets that provide a high-resolution view of our customers, we must use them to create the most personalized experience. Customer Engagement is the Outcome. In the Retail Supply Chain, this calls for a Omni-channel approach to provide the customer with an integrated customer experience. </p><p>This requires one to understand the shifts in consumer behaviours, needs, and beliefs that will help you unlock fresh insights to drive your business. The end goal is to seek the Customer's Delight.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <h6>Forecasting & Predictive Analytics:</h6>
        <p>With forecasting, we assume that what occurred in the past is the best indicator of the future and in Predictive Analytics we also analyses the influencers, interactions and activities of the keys actors in the equation.</p><p>The forecasting and Predictive lens is clearer because of our ability to segment data sets and analyse end-user behaviour.</p>

   <h5>Our Methodology:</h5>
   <p>We break the Analytics journey into more detailed iterative steps which we call as the AyamiH Analytics Life Cycle.</p>
    <ul class="numbers">
        <li>
        <h6>Identify the Client's Business Needs:</h6>
        <p>Our Business Advisors liase with the Clients Team to identify the Opportunities of our Client. We define the scope, market conditions and goals related to the business question that our Client wants to solve, which will lead to the selection of one or more modelling method.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <h6>Prepare the Data:</h6>
        <p>Wes McKinney, the author of Python for Data Analysis, defines Data Preparation as “cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, and reshaping, slicing, dicing, and transforming data for analysis.” </p><p>At AyamiH, depending on the business requirements of the Client and proposed analysis methods, this step involves using one or many of the above methods to clean and prepare the data for optimal results.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <h6>Explore the Data:</h6>
        <p>This is where we explore the Data in an interactive and visual manner to identify the relevant variables, trends and relationships.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <h6>Create Models:</h6>
        <p>In this step, our skilled team at AyamiH builds the model using quantitative methods, data mining and text mining methods to determine the model that produces the best results.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <h6>Validate Model:</h6>
        <p>Once built, this selected model is tested and validated against your Data.</p>
        </li> 
              
        <li>
        <h6>Deploy Model:</h6>
        <p>After the Approval for use in production, the model is applied to new data to generate predictive insights.</p>
        </li> 
                     
        <li>
        <h6>Monitor and Assess the Models:</h6>
        <p>The predictive performance of the model is monitored to ensure it is up to date and delivering valid results. If the model performance degrades, it’s time to make changes. When it no longer works or serves a business need, it is archived</p>
        </li>
